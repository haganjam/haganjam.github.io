#### About me

I'm a ecologist/biologist by training with a fondness for data science and statistics. My favourite tools are R and Stan.   
<br>

#### Current position

Currently I'm a PhD student at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. I'm interested in developing high-quality, meaningful biodiversity indicators and analytical methods to quantify how biological communities affect various ecosystem processes.

#### Hometown | Education   

I took BSc with a major in *ecology and evolution* from the University of Cape Town, South Africa (my home town). From then, I completed an MSc in Tropical Biology on an Erasmus Mundus scholarship before starting my current position.
