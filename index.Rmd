#### ABOUT ME

I'm a ecologist/biologist by training with a fondness for data science and statistics. My favourite tools are R and Stan.  

I took a *BSc* with a major in *Ecology and Evolution* from the University of Cape Town, South Africa (my home town). From then, I completed an *MSc* in Tropical Biology on an Erasmus Mundus scholarship before starting my current position as a a PhD student at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden.
